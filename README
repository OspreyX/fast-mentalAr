This is a short command line program. Can be used to train 
for mental arithmetic tests such as the ones from Optiver and Tibra.

You can compile it on a Linux or Windows machine, or simply run the binary file.
Probably works on Macs too, although I haven't checked. Once compiled, run 
the executable and just train until you feel ready.
Test is timed and you have 8 minutes to answer as many questions as you can. 
The goal is to get more than 54 points, as in the test from Optiver. 
The test is fairly similar, it might be slightly harder, but only slightly. 
All the types of questions that may arise in the Optiver test are coded in the simulation and can come up. 
The code itself is not the prettiest or most optimal. 
I didn't spend much time fine tuning it, but it gets the job done. 
If you want to train for the test, this is probably one of the better ways to go.
